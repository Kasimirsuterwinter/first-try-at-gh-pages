          <p> Professionally I am an architect and designer from NY, currently studying at the Architectural Institute in Prague.
          </p>In my free time I am an open source enthusiast, who dreams of free open design and local distributed manufacturing, as an equitable business model!

          <p> Recently I co-founded dot collective, with two close friends. We are a growing community of designers and entrepreneurs sharing ideas and work which we believe in!
          </p>

          <p> Teaching is a passion of mine, and luckily I found the education startup Design Disco! Where I get to share my beliefe that design can make our lives on earth better.
